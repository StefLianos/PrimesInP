# PrimesInP

This tool attempts to implement multiple prime testing algorithm to compare their execution times.
It also allows the user to feed it a CSV file as an input.

## Algorithms

* Simple check until the root of the input
* [Fermat's Little Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem)
* [The AKS Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test)

## Built using
* JAVA for the algorithm
* JAVA swing for the front end
